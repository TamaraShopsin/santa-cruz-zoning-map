<p><strong>Starting a business requires some paper work. Sorry, it's the law.</strong><br />
  It is important that all businesses comply with zoning and licensing. </p>
<p>Zoning helps set the character of community and creates neighborhoods.<br />
  By clustering types of businesses, you reduce traffic and can share services.<br />
  Zoning also makes sure your rights don't impinge on your neighbor's rights and vise versa.</p>
<p>*It makes sure a rubber factory can't open next to a preschool.</p>
<p>Once you get your zoning clearance you are set and don't need to think about it unless you relocate.</p>
<p>Business Licenses help the city categorize employers and keep track of its employment base. This is important information that guides city services. Your business Licenses needs to be renewed each year. To be honest, it more of a tax than a license.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Every business in Santa Cruz needs a business license and a zoning clearance, even if you are working from home.</strong></p>
<p>There are additional requirements from the city depending on what you do and where you are located.</p>
<strong>If you are working from home there is not much required!</strong> You can apply online. Please click here for more information and the application. You don't need to read on, unless you want to learn about the best practices for selecting a space and the permits involved.
<p>If your business is in a space other than your home it is more complicated. Sorry, but trust us it is for the common good. You can't currently apply online but here are some tips and advice:</p>
<div id="Accordion1" class="Accordion" tabindex="0">
  <div class="AccordionPanel">
    <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Think about prior use of the space</div>
    <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
      <p>The best thing is to go into a space that had a prior use that is as similar to yours as possible.</p>
      <p>If you are opening a restaurant try to go into a space that held a restaurant.<br />
        If you are opening a yoga studio try to go into say a karate studio.</p>
      <p>This will make it more likely that your use will be approved.<br />
        Just because a space is zoned for your use doesn't mean your use will be approved.<br />
        The most likely problem is that the space doesn't have enough parking!<br />
        If the past use matches your use, the zoning will match and  parking will likely not be an issue.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="AccordionPanel">
    <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Think about parking</div>
    <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
      <p>The parking issue!</p>
      <p>That a business provide sufficient parking is very important. If you don't have enough spaces people will use the street which will block traffic or use other businesses spots which is not fair.</p>
      <p>Use effects spaces needed. More people buy food than couches.<br />
        People park longer at a gym than a shoe store.</p>
      <p>A Gym has a more &quot;intense&quot; use than a shoe store. This means more parking is needed.<br />
        It also means more people use the gym. This means more cars on the road.</p>
      <p>If you are downtown you don't need to provide parking. But you must pay for it.<br />
        No parking is free!</p>
      <p>Remember shared parking doesn't count as your parking (unless you are downtown)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="AccordionPanel">
    <div class="AccordionPanelTab">If you change a space to a more intense use.. </div>
    <div class="AccordionPanelContent">you must mitigate the cost. It costs a lot of money to keep the traffic of Santa Cruz flowing. If you create a use that has a higher traffic need than the past space the city needs a way to mitigate this cost.  Enter the dreaded TIF (Traffic Impact Fee). This fee can be $1000 to $200,000 ! This fee covers the cost of traffic improvements like wider lanes and signalized intersections. This is the top reason of why finding a location with a similar use to yours is smart. If you love a space with a bad TIF you should talk to The office of Economic Development. They will try to help.</div>

  <div class="AccordionPanel">
    <div class="AccordionPanelTab">$cary space problems:</div>
    <div class="AccordionPanelContent">-If you need to put in a sprinkler system.<br />
    -If there is asbestos.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Are you zoned right?</p>
<p>here is a tool to help you determine the zoning.</p>
<p>Zone map<br />
  <br />
  If the location is not zoned for your use. You should choose another location if this seems wrong please talk to zoning and they will try to help or explain why it is so.</p>
<p>Back to this Idea that different uses have additional requirements</p>

<p>Last  thing you'll need is a business licence.</p>
<p>If you are doing any business within the city limits of Santa Cruz, you need a business license.</p>
<p>If you are doing any business in the city limits of Santa Cruz, you are required to have a City of Santa Cruz Business License Tax Certificate.</p>
<p>Apply for the certificate on or before the day you start business.</p>
<p>The business license tax is not refundable and not transferable.</p>
<p>Payment of the Business License Tax Certificate does not relieve the applicant of any regulatory provisions, including, but not limited to City Ordinances.</p>
